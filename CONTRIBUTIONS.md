const_poly follows [Gitflow workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).
A few simple rules:

1. Do not work on `main` branch directly.
2. Use `features/<features_to_improve>` branch. For example, if you want to improve `trignometric_functions` then create `features/trignometric_functions` on latest `main` branch & create pull request to `main` branch.
3. Test before push. Use `cargo test --features <required_features>`

Thank you for all the contributions!
